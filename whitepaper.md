# Agentic Application Architecture: A Two-Layer LLM Framework for Modern Software Development

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel architectural paradigm for software development that replaces traditional API-based systems with intelligent, agent-driven architectures. We present a two-layer Large Language Model (LLM) framework where the first layer acts as a rule engine and action executor, while the second layer provides continuous validation and monitoring. This approach enables natural language rule definition, automatic action execution, and intelligent oversight without blocking user operations.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional software development has been constrained by rigid API structures, hardcoded business logic, and the need for extensive programming knowledge to modify system behavior. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine how applications are built, deployed, and maintained.

We propose an **Agentic Application Architecture** that leverages two distinct LLM layers to create intelligent, self-monitoring systems capable of understanding natural language rules, executing complex actions, and maintaining continuous oversight without human intervention.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Limitations

Modern software systems face several critical challenges:

1. **Rigid Business Logic**: Business rules are hardcoded in application logic, requiring developer intervention for any changes
2. **API Complexity**: REST/SOAP APIs create tight coupling between frontend and backend systems
3. **Limited Adaptability**: Systems cannot easily adapt to changing business requirements without code modifications
4. **Monitoring Overhead**: Continuous monitoring and validation require separate systems and human oversight
5. **Scalability Constraints**: Adding new features requires extensive development cycles and testing

### 2.2 The Need for Agentic Systems

As business requirements become increasingly complex and dynamic, there is a growing need for systems that can:
- Understand and execute natural language instructions
- Adapt to changing rules without code modifications
- Provide intelligent oversight and validation
- Scale automatically with business complexity
- Maintain transparency and auditability

## 3. Two-Layer LLM Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

Our architecture consists of two independent LLM layers that work in parallel:

1. **Primary Agent Layer (LLM-1)**: Rule engine, action executor, and decision maker
2. **Validation Layer (LLM-2)**: Continuous monitor, anomaly detector, and oversight provider

### 3.2 Primary Agent Layer (LLM-1)

The Primary Agent Layer serves as the core decision-making and execution engine of the system.

#### 3.2.1 Components

**Rule Engine**
- Interprets natural language business rules
- Validates user actions against defined constraints
- Provides structured decision outputs
- Maintains rule context and relationships

**Action Executor**
- Executes approved actions using tool functions
- Generates structured JSON responses
- Maintains execution audit trails
- Handles action rollback and error recovery

**Feature Router**
- Routes user requests to appropriate rule sets
- Manages feature-action-parameter mappings
- Provides context-aware decision making

#### 3.2.2 Operation Flow

```
User Action → Feature Identification → Rule Validation → Action Execution → Structured Response
```

The Primary Agent receives structured prompts containing:
- Feature identifier
- Action type
- Parameter values
- User context
- Applicable rule sets

It then evaluates the action against natural language rules and either executes the action or provides a denial with explanation.

### 3.3 Validation Layer (LLM-2)

The Validation Layer operates independently and asynchronously to provide continuous oversight and monitoring.

#### 3.3.1 Components

**Anomaly Detector**
- Monitors Primary Agent decisions and actions
- Identifies potential rule violations or unusual patterns
- Flags deviations from expected behavior
- Provides confidence scores for decisions

**Performance Monitor**
- Tracks decision accuracy and consistency
- Monitors response times and system performance
- Identifies potential system degradation
- Provides optimization recommendations

**Developer Notifier**
- Alerts development teams to potential issues
- Provides detailed analysis of anomalies
- Suggests rule improvements or system optimizations
- Maintains oversight without blocking operations

#### 3.3.2 Operation Flow

```
Primary Agent Action → Parallel Validation → Anomaly Detection → Developer Notification
```

The Validation Layer operates non-blocking and never interferes with user operations. It provides continuous monitoring and alerts without affecting system performance or user experience.

## 4. Architecture Design Principles

### 4.1 Separation of Concerns

The two-layer architecture ensures clear separation between:
- **Execution Logic** (Primary Agent)
- **Oversight Logic** (Validation Layer)
- **User Interface** (Traditional UI components)
- **Business Rules** (Natural language definitions)

### 4.2 Non-Blocking Validation

The Validation Layer operates asynchronously and never blocks or modifies user actions. This ensures:
- Uninterrupted user experience
- Continuous system operation
- Independent oversight capabilities
- No performance impact on primary operations

### 4.3 Natural Language Rule Definition

Business rules are defined in natural language using standardized patterns:

```
[FEATURE] can only be [ACTION] if [PARAMETER] meets [CONDITION]
```

This approach enables:
- Non-technical users to define business logic
- Instant rule modifications without code changes
- Human-readable rule documentation
- Flexible and expressive rule definitions

### 4.4 Structured Response Format

All agent responses follow a standardized JSON structure:

```json
{
  "decision": "ALLOWED|DENIED|ERROR",
  "reason": "Human-readable explanation",
  "rule_violated": "Specific rule if denied",
  "execution_result": "Action execution details",
  "confidence_score": "Decision confidence level"
}
```

## 5. Implementation Framework

### 5.1 Frontend Integration

Traditional UI components interact with the agentic system through a standardized interface:

1. **Feature Definition**: UI components define feature names, actions, and parameters
2. **Prompt Generation**: System automatically generates structured prompts
3. **Agent Communication**: Frontend calls Primary Agent with structured prompts
4. **Response Handling**: UI processes structured responses and updates accordingly

### 5.2 Backend Architecture

The backend consists of:

1. **Agent Orchestrator**: Manages communication between UI and LLM layers
2. **Rule Repository**: Stores and manages natural language rules
3. **Action Registry**: Maintains available actions and tool functions
4. **Audit System**: Logs all decisions, actions, and validations
5. **Notification System**: Manages developer alerts and oversight communications

### 5.3 Tool Function Integration

The Primary Agent executes actions through predefined tool functions:

- Database operations
- External API calls
- File system operations
- Communication services
- Business process workflows

Each tool function is registered with the system and can be invoked by the agent based on rule evaluation results.
