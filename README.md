# 🧑‍💻 AI-Native Rule Engine for Attendance Management

## Overview

This project demonstrates an **AI-native, agentic approach** to rule-based systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of traditional hardcoded logic, rules are defined in natural language and dynamically evaluated by AI agents.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Traditional Approach Problems:**
- Complex rule logic hardcoded in application code
- Database schema changes required for new rules
- Difficult to modify rules without programming knowledge
- Scalability issues with complex rule combinations
- Time-consuming development for rule changes

**AI-Native Solution Benefits:**
- ✅ Rules defined in plain English
- ✅ Zero-code rule modifications
- ✅ Dynamic rule evaluation by LLM
- ✅ Human-readable decision explanations
- ✅ Scalable to unlimited rule complexity
- ✅ Non-programmers can manage rules

### Core Components

1. **Rule Storage**: JSON files with natural language rules
2. **LLM Agent**: OpenAI GPT-4 for rule interpretation
3. **User Interface**: Streamlit for both users and administrators
4. **Rule Management**: Dynamic rule editing without code changes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install streamlit openai python-dotenv
```

### Setup
1. Create a `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

2. Run the main application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Run the rule management interface:
```bash
streamlit run rule_manager.py
```

## 📋 Rule Examples

### Rule Set #1 (Strict Office Policy)
```json
{
  "name": "Strict Office Policy",
  "rules": [
    "ATTENDANCE can only be CHECKED-IN at the project LOCATION.",
    "CHECK-IN allowed only after 08:00.",
    "CHECK-OUT not allowed after 22:00."
  ]
}
```

### Rule Set #2 (Flexible Work Policy)
```json
{
  "name": "Flexible Work Policy", 
  "rules": [
    "ATTENDANCE can be CHECKED-IN from anywhere.",
    "CHECK-IN allowed only after 10:00.",
    "CHECK-OUT not allowed after 23:30."
  ]
}
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. User Experience
1. User selects their profile (user_1, user_2, etc.)
2. User chooses check-in time and location
3. User clicks "CHECK-IN" or "CHECK-OUT"
4. AI agent evaluates rules in real-time
5. Clear decision with explanation is displayed

### 2. AI Agent Process
```
User Action → Context Gathering → Rule Retrieval → LLM Evaluation → Decision
```

**Example Scenario:**
- **User**: user_1 (Strict Office Policy)
- **Action**: CHECK-IN
- **Time**: 07:30 AM
- **Location**: Home
- **AI Evaluation**: 
  - Rule 1: ❌ Location violation (must be at project location)
  - Rule 2: ❌ Time violation (must be after 8:00 AM)
- **Result**: DENIED with clear explanation

### 3. Rule Management
- **Add Rules**: Natural language input through UI
- **Edit Rules**: Modify existing rules without coding
- **User Assignment**: Assign users to rule sets
- **Export/Import**: Backup and restore rule configurations

## 🔧 Features

## 🎨 UI Components

### Main Interface
- **User Selection**: Choose user profile
- **Time Input**: Select check-in/out time
- **Location Selection**: Choose from available locations
- **Action Buttons**: CHECK-IN, CHECK-OUT, Rule Analysis
- **Results Display**: AI evaluation with explanations

### Rule Management Interface
- **Rule Viewer**: Browse all rule sets
- **Rule Editor**: Add/edit rules in natural language
- **User Manager**: Assign users to rule sets
- **Settings**: Configure system parameters

## 🔍 AI Evaluation Process

### Context Provided to LLM
```python
{
  "user": "user_1",
  "action": "CHECK-IN",
  "time": "08:15",
  "location": "Dubai Marina",
  "project_location": "Dubai Marina",
  "rules": [
    "ATTENDANCE can only be CHECKED-IN at the project LOCATION.",
    "CHECK-IN allowed only after 08:00.",
    "CHECK-OUT not allowed after 22:00."
  ]
}
```

### LLM Response Format
```
Decision: ALLOWED
Reason: User is at the correct location (project location) and time is after 8:00 AM
Rule Violated: None
```
